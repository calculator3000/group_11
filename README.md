# Project Agros: analysis of the world’s agricultural output

## Description
The repository contains our advanced programming group project, using data on agriculture by Our World in Data, analyzing the world’s agricultural production between the years 1961 and 2019. The goal is to contribute to the green transition.

Our main analysis can be found in the showcase Jupyter Notebook. 

The project is shared work by:\
Julia Stieler - 56040, 56040@novasbe.pt\
Hannah Dickescheid - 50178, 50178@novasbe.pt\
Carlos Ferrufino - 53276, 53276@novasbe.pt\
Eva Zinser - 53100, 53100@novasbe.pt

## Data
We are using data on Agricultural total factor productivity (USDA), downloaded from Our World in Data, (datasource can be found [here](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Agricultural%20total%20factor%20productivity%20(USDA)))

The original data was published by the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service.

## Getting started
1. The environment was saved in the file ```agrosenv.yml```\.
To learn how to use the environment, follow the documentation found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

2. Documentation was built using sphinx. 
To view it, open ```docs/_build/html/index.html```.

3. The showcase notebook ```showcase_notebook.ipynb``` contains an analysis of the data.

4. All methods used are part of the class Agros ```python_files/agros_class.py```.
